    .

### Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)

HCPCS is a set of codes used to describe non-physician services, including medical supplies, equipment, and certain services not covered by CPT codes. It is divided into two levels:

- **Level I**: These are the CPT codes themselves.
- **Level II**: These codes are used for products, supplies, and services not included in CPT, such as ambulance services and durable medical equipment
